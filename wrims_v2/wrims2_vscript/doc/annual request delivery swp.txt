Annual request delivery

It is more of an input than a calculation.  The values in the table represent the aggregate request by SWP contractors of the amount of  their Table A Entitlement that they want for each year.  They can request any amount up to their full contract entitlement.  We assume that AG contractors behave similarly and that  most M&I contractors behave similarly.  Metropolitan Water District (MWD), which holds the largest SWP contract entitlement, is the one exception of M&I contractor and behaves according to its own operational needs.  Future level studies have been set at Full Entitlement which means we assume that each contractor will request their full entitlement every year.  Some of our Existing level studies assume variable demand where there are reduced demands in years when we assume the southern part of the state is fairly wet (when Kern River Annual flow is greater than 1500 TAF).  MWD also conducts their own studies that tell them how much they will request each year of our simulation.  We take that input from them directly. Erik
