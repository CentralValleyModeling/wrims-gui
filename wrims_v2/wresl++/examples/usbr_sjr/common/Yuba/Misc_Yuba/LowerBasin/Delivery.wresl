!Coded by Andy Draper June 2004.

!The variable 'allocation' is set in March cycle 2.
!It is the annual allocation decision for YCWA based on
!a multi-period optimization for the period April-September

!The state variable D230_alloc is used to impose this allocation
!on the monthly deliveries.

!The decision variable D230_alloc_dv provides access to the
!allocation decision in following months.
