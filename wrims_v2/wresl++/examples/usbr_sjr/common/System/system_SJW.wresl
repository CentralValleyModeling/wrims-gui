! THIS FILE CONTAINS THE NAMES OF ALL INCLUDE FILES FOR THE SYSTEM DESCRIPTION
! NOTE -- In this setup, we have one top-level system file and two system directories, 
!         one for West-Side SJW and one for East-Side SJW. Completely splitting 
!         East/West SJW (with two top-level system files) would be tedious and isn't
!         worth doing at this time...
