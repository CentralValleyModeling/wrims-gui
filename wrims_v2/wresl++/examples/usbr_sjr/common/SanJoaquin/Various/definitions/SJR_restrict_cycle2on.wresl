/*
Chowchilla Bypass operations
The Chowchilla Bypass splits Millerton flood flows that flow past Gravelly Ford
(Millerton does not release water for demands past Gravelly Ford).
The Bypass structure allows 2000 cfs to flow into the Mendota Pool before routing water
through the Chowchilla Bypass (in order to protect the Riparian land around the Mendota
Pool.  The Bypass has a channel capacity of 6500 cfs which if exceeded will flood
back into the Mendota Pool.  Therefore, the operations are as follows:
   1)up to 1400 cfs through C_SJR205_main
   2)the next 6500 cfs through D_SJR214_EBP001
   3)any flows above 7900 cfs through C_SJR205_flood
System defined restrictions on D_SJR214_EBP001 give it an upper limit of 6500 and a negative weight
C_SJR205_flood needs to have a larger negative weight than D_SJR214_EBP001 for a correct order of filling
