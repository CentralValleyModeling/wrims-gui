Sets minimum flows for American River below Nimbus and H St for FAM.

Minflow below Nimbus is set according to a CVP Lookup Table that looks at Folsom
storage (Oct-Feb) or Folsom storage and forecasted inflow (Mar-Sept).  If Folsom
storage is not > 200, then Nimbus uses H St minflow standard.  

Commented out code for Nimbus standard since we are using FMS for Nimbus standard.
