Defines Standard allowable & Max allowable pumping at Banks in FAM.  Banks can increase pumping
up to 1/3 of San Joaquin River flow at Vernalis if flow at Vernalis is greater than 1000 cfs.

   If SJR flow @ Vernalis > 1000 cfs then,
   Banks_max_allow = Banks_standard_allow + 1/3*(SJR @ Vernalis)
   But only upto physical capacity.
