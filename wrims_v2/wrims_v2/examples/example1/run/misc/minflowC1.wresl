/*
Minimum Flow Constraint on Arc C1
*/

! Define the required minimum flow
define minflow_C1 {
  case OctJan {
    condition month>=OCT .and. month<= JAN
    value     3250. } ! cfs
  case other {
    condition always ! "always" evaluates to true
    value     2000. } ! cfs
}

! Meet the minimum flow target
! written as "<" because variable C1_MIF is weighted
goal meetMinflowC1 { C1_MIF < minflow_C1 }
