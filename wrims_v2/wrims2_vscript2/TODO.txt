Bug:

(1) misleading error message when table not found in lookup table directory 



Inputs from Satya:

(1) Be able to use the studies in CalliteGUI for position analysis runs.
(2) Be able to start run from arbitrary month
(3) Be able to use his own hydrology forecast


Works needed to address the above 3 items:
(1) Need to modify studies in CalLiteGUI to be more general. 
    Better to have a centralized version control for CalLite wresl codes so the changes won't be lost.
(2) Need to look into CalLite study to figure why October is hardwired and if those hardwired codes can be removed.
(3) This one is difficult. Need to figure out all those SVAR used in CalLite study.
