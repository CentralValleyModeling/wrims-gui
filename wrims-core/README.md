# WRIMS-core: the compute engine for WRIMS
WRIMS is DWR's generalized water resources modeling system for evaluating operational alternatives of large, complex river basins.
WRIMS integrates a simulation language for flexible operational criteria specification, a linear programming solver for efficient water allocation decisions, and graphics capabilities for ease of use. These combined capabilities provide a comprehensive and powerful modeling tool for water resource systems simulation.

WRIMS-core is a Java package that reads a WRIMS input file, processes the data, and writes the results to an output file.
WRIMS-core can be run as a command-line application from a batch process or shell scirpt.

Prior to the present revison of the WRIMS build system, the equivalent of WRIMS-core was a jar file named WRIMSv2.jar.
